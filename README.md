# Space-Trader
Space Trader Game Developed for CS2340 using Object Oriented Design Principles taught in class. Team Git Schwifty - Hritik Sapra, Riya Agrawal, Inan Batra, Pulak Agarwal 

# App Development
We decided to use the MVVM Architectural Pattern to implement the app. We created UML Class and Sequences diagrams and UI Flow Diagrams. Through implementation of Agile Development Methodologies including, but not limited to, SCRUM, we were able to create a cohesive and functional team. We also employed the use of ZenHub as our scrum board.

# My Role
I developed much of the back end of the app by integrating a firebase database. I helped in the development of the travelling mechanism as well as the trading algorithms used in the app.
